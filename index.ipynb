While computationally expensive, they can be powerful tools providing substantial performance gains in many instances.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Kernel Functions\n", "\n", "Probably the most important information worth reviewing is some of the various kernel functions that you can apply:\n", "\n", "1. Radial Basis Function (RBF)\n", "    1. `c`\n", "    2. $\\gamma$, which can be specified using `gamma` in scikit-learn\n", "2.

Moreover, learning to properly tune SVMs using kernels and an appropriate `c` value is critical."]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
